# envar

This package allows parsing ENV vars into struct fields using a tag that can
be optionally defined apart from the default (`env`).

## Usage

See `parser_test.go` for full examples.

## TODO:

 - [ ] - implement ENV VAR expansion. This is already started but will perhaps
     take a different approach.
